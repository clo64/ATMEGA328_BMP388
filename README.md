# ATMEGA328_BMP388
Basic communication functions for controlling the Bosch BMP388 with an ATMEGA328

 I struggled to make sense of the provided drivers and found specific help in writing the nexessary SPI functions to be lacking. I hope that someone stumbles upon this working implementation and finds it useful.
  
  The UART functions I provide are very spare and utilitarian. The nature of the project I'm incorporating these elements into doesn't require a great deal of "on the fly" changing of settings, therefore many settings are hardcoded into the functions.

 Feel free to make changes to any of these documents to improve portability, utility or performance.
